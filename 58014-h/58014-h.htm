<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>To</i></span><i> the congregational
Churches of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>particularly that one over which
the Holy Ghost hath made me an Overseer</i>: <i>Grace be to you
all</i>.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.&mdash;I thought it necessary to write
to you on some Subjects which are very interesting, and to give
you in sundry articles, the particulars of the Faith we profess,
as believers in our most adorable Redeemer; with a few agreements
which claim the conformity of all those who have given themselves
up to the Lord, to walk in all well pleasing to him.&nbsp; I haw
endeavored to keep close to the sacred pages, which are the grand
standard of Faith and Practice, and as many as walk according
this rule, peace be on them, and on the whole Israel of God.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The first
Subject I wish my brethren well instructed in is the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It must be allowed that the ever
blessed God, for the purposes of glorifying his grace, hath
chosen a number of persons in Christ&mdash;that he gave them to
Christ&mdash;that the Redeemer accepted them, and delighted in
them as his Bride&mdash;and though he foreknew their fall in
Adam, yet he covenanted with the Father to be their Surety,
Righteousness, and Mediator&mdash;to deliver them from the hands
of their enemies by his precious sacrifice, and in due time to
call them by his holy Spirit, to the knowledge of himself; to
preserve them in himself till called, and maintain them in the
wilderness of this world till their glorification.&nbsp; All
these things being planned before all worlds, in due time the
Redeemer came, according to his engagement, and paid down his
life for their Justification and Pardon&mdash;in consequence of
which, Justice being satisfied, the Law honoured, Sinners
redeemed, and the Holy Spirit, with all its blessing secured, the
Church of God is called, one member after another, and will be so
till the whole body is complete: hence the Apostle says, Christ
loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might save it
with the washing of water, by the Word&mdash;the glorious Gospel
of the blessed God is the means made use of, to bring poor
sinners to the knowledge of Jesus&mdash;truth having an entrance
into the heart, influences all the powers, enlightens the
understanding, subdues and reconciles the will, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>sways the
affections, captivates the thoughts, and quickens the
conscience.&nbsp; Thus the entrance of God&rsquo;s word giveth
light, and God shines into the heart, sooner or later, to give
them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the
Person of Jesus.&nbsp; This is attended with love to God, as seen
in Jesus&mdash;love to the Redeemer, in his Person, Work, and
Offices&mdash;love to the Holy Spirit, who has done so much for
the soul, and stands engaged to do much more.&nbsp; This love is
led forth to ministers who are sent of God, especially to those
whose ministry is most blessed to us, of whatever denomination
they may be.&nbsp; This same principle of love is led forth to
those who bear the image of Christ, who are divinely taught,
whether they are Children, young Men, or Fathers&mdash;for, <i>he
that loveth is born of God</i>, and knoweth God&mdash;Ye are
taught of God to love one another&mdash;<i>he that loveth him
that begat loveth him also that is begotten</i>.&nbsp; This fire
within catcheth itself wherever it is&mdash;in another&mdash;thus
there is a unity of heart; this unity of heart is attended with a
willingness to know, and do the will of God; to worship him
according to his declared will, as laid down in the New
Testament&mdash;to assemble together for Prayer, reading the Word
of God, and hearing it faithfully preached by those whom God hath
sent.&nbsp; It is to submit to all his Ordinances,
<i>Baptism</i>, as we are led to see it right, and the
<i>Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i>, with the rest of the Lord&rsquo;s
people; and a walking in holy obedience to the revealed will of
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>God.&nbsp;
This appears to be the Church of God, which he purchased with his
blood; that he always protects, and will maintain as long as the
world lasts.&nbsp; This is called his invisible Church (not to
himself) but to the work, they being attended with others in the
same profession, though not the same <i>possession</i>; and
making this profession public in their non-conformity to the
world, in being called from among them as well as redeemed from
among them; in consequence of these things they are called the
visible Church of Christ, which has been called <i>Catholic</i>,
or <i>general</i> Church.</p>
<p>This Church is variously set forth in Scripture, which is
worthy our attention, with its present and future glory.&nbsp;
Permit me to remark, that many persons suppose a Church to be
nothing but a large building: this is not called a Church in
Scripture&mdash;it does not mean the <i>Place</i> but the
<i>People</i>&mdash;the professors of the Gospel, whether called
effectually or not, yet walking together in the Ordinances, and
appearing to serve the same Master, the whole body is called a
Church.&nbsp; There is no pure or perfect Church this side
Heaven; in this great House there are not only vessels of gold
and silver, but of wood and stone; the wise and foolish virgins
must be together till the midnight cry is made&mdash;the tares
and the wheat must grow together till the harvest&mdash;the net
will contain good and bad fish, till the final separation takes
place.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>This
Church of Christ is not Parochial, men do not become church
Members by living in the Parish, for Jews and Turks may live in
the same Parish; nor is it Diocesan, for we never read of more
than one Church under one Bishop or Pastor&mdash;nor is it
Provincial, for we read of more Churches than one in a
Province&mdash;nor is it National, for we not only read of more
than one in a Nation, but of Churches in private houses&mdash;nor
is a Presbyterian, for we never read of a Church of Presbyters or
Elders, no; but only of Presbyters and Elders ordained in
Churches; this must plainly prove that Churches existed before
the Presbytery or Elders were in them&mdash;then it appears plain
that the visible Church of Christ is congregational&mdash;so the
Church of England has justly defined it&mdash;&ldquo;The Church
of God is a Congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word
of God is preached and the Sacraments duly administered;&rdquo;
for only the Lord&rsquo;s faithful people can have fellowship
with each other&mdash;they must be regenerated by the Spirit,
called out of darkness into the kingdom of God&rsquo;s dear
Son&mdash;they are called Saints because of their Sanctification,
faithful men to God and truth, such as should be saved.&nbsp;
They are spiritual men, understanding spiritual things; men of
holiness, whose lives and conversation are becoming the
Gospel&mdash;baptized into Christ, invisibly, by the Spirit, and
outwardly by Water, if God is pleased to shew them that it is
right, for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&nbsp; These <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>are the Persons
who have a right to chuse their Ministers, their Officers, and to
use all the Ordinances and Privileges granted to the Church by
our glorious Lord and Master, Christ, who is the king, head, and
saviour of his Elect.&nbsp; It appears the word Church signifies
a sacred Assembly or Society, called of God by the Gospel, met
together to worship God according to his revealed will.&nbsp; Let
this suffice, the Church, in its just and expensive sense,
includes <i>the whole body of the redeemed</i>.</p>
<p>This Church has appeared in every age of the world; been kept
up and supported in a very wonderful manner, which made Solomon
exclaim, in raptures of affection, wonder, and delight, <i>Who is
this that cometh up from the Wilderness</i>, <i>like pillars of
smoke</i>, <i>perfumed with myrrh and frankinsense</i>, <i>with
all the powders of the Merchant</i>?&mdash;The History of the Old
Testament is but an History of the Church, which, though
afflicted, tormented, and tossed with many tempests, yet was
miraculously preserved by the Lord Jesus, who never left the
world without a witness for himself, nor never will.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis wonderful to trace her rise and prosperity, her
persecution and deliverance, till the present hour&mdash;and as
my dear friends (many of them at least) have but little time to
read History, I presume to give them a brief Account of the
Church in the Wilderness, for which I am indebted under God, to
Historians.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>When our
Lord made his appearance in the likeness of sinful flesh, he
thoroughly purged the floor of his Old Testament Church&mdash;he
effected a wonderful revolution, set aside every carnal
ordinance, and fulfilled all laws, moral and ceremonial.&nbsp;
After his death and resurrection he went to glory, that he might
fill all things.&nbsp; He endued his Apostles with power from on
high&mdash;raised up a company of preachers, who were means in
the hands of the Spirit, for building Sanctuaries to God.&nbsp;
The middle wall of partition was now broken down&mdash;the
Gentiles were fellow-citizens with the Jews, and both made up one
household.&nbsp; We shortly after read of Churches in many parts
of the world.&nbsp; For the first fifty years after our
Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the Gospel was most powerfully
successful&mdash;God sent forth the rod of his strength, and much
good was done in the name of the holy child, Jesus.&mdash;But
Satan roared loudly; the Church was in the Wilderness&mdash;and
as it had been persecuted as related by the Apostle in the 13th
of the <i>Hebrews</i>, so it was again&mdash;they under the New
Testament Dispensation, were persecuted, beaten, sawn
asunder&mdash;they wandered about in Sheep&rsquo;s and
Goat&rsquo;s skins, and hid themselves in dens and caves of the
earth.&nbsp; Surely the New Testament Saints are included in that
pathetic address, <i>Oh</i>! <i>thou afflicted</i>, <i>tossed
with tempest</i>, <i>and not comforted</i>.&nbsp; Errors in
doctrine soon appeared, even to the denying of the resurrection
of the body&mdash;Ordinances were soon <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>corrupted, and worldly-mindedness was
prevalent.&nbsp; Persecution wasted the Church of God very early
in the year 66; it began by imperial authority.&nbsp; <i>Nero</i>
having burnt a part of the Roman City, charged it upon the
Christians, and enacted laws to destroy them, and multitudes of
them were burnt alive in his garden, for nightly illumination: in
this Persecution, it is supposed <i>Paul</i> and <i>Peter</i>
suffered death.&nbsp; About the year 72 <i>Domitian</i> raised a
new Persecution, but he was soon murdered by his wife.&nbsp;
About three years after it began, in 105, <i>Trajan</i>, the
Emperor, raised a third Persecution, which lasted about two
years.&nbsp; Then a fourth Persecution by <i>Adrian</i>, which
lasted ten years&mdash;besides, vast numbers of Christians were
murdered by the Jewish rebels.&nbsp; For a long time the Church
was quiet from outward Persecution, but awfully infested with
errors, which became an internal Persecution.&nbsp; About the
year 302, the infernal Emperor raised a dreadful one against the
Christians; many were scourged to death, had their flesh torn off
with red hot pincers, and mangled with broken pots.&nbsp; They
were cast to wild beasts, beheaded, crucified, burnt, drowned,
torn to pieces between trees, roasted by gentle fires, and some,
having holes made in the body, had melted lead poured into their
bowels.&nbsp; In Egypt alone, an hundred and forty thousand were
cut off by violent deaths, and seven hundred thousand by
banishment and hard labour.&nbsp; In every part of the Empire
churches <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>were razed to the ground, and the copies of the
Scriptures burnt.&nbsp; Now they thought they had utterly
abolished the Religion of Jesus; but the vengeance of God
followed the hellish tyrant, as it had <i>Herod</i>, <i>Nero</i>,
&amp; <i>Domitian</i> before.&nbsp; <i>C&aelig;sar</i> obliged
him to resign his post, and retire to a private life, where he
soon ended his days by a draft of poison.</p>
<p>God raised up <i>Constantine</i>, the Man Child spoken of in
the 12th chapter of <i>Revelations</i>; he tolerated the
Christians.&nbsp; His colleague revoked it in the East, and,
instigated by the Heathen Priests, made war against
<i>Licinius</i>.&nbsp; The brother-in-law of <i>Constantine</i>,
enraged at his army being routed, he murdered a multitude of the
Priests, who had promised him the victory.&nbsp; He was just
going to venture a second battle, when he was smitten with
blindness and terrible pain: he poisoned himself, and amidst
rage, pain, and despair, acknowledged his trouble the just reward
for his cruelty to the Christians.&nbsp; <i>Licinius</i> for a
time seemed to favor the Christians, yet soon turned a bitter
Persecutor; but <i>Constantine</i> being now a Christian, marched
a great army against him, and defeated him in three great
battles, in the last of which an hundred thousand were slain,
<i>Licinius</i> taken, and put to death.&nbsp; Thus we see the
Bush long burning, and not consumed, because the <i>Angel of the
Covenant</i> was in it&mdash;and this is he that was with the
Church in the Wilderness.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The
Christians now enjoyed a great calm under the reign of
<i>Constantine</i> and <i>Theodosius</i>; but Satan always took
an opportunity to ruin the Church by Heresies when he could not
by Persecution.&nbsp; Arianism, and many other errors were
propogated, which occasioned dreadful troubles to the
Church.&nbsp; <i>Julian</i> the Apostate, endeavored once more to
extirpate Christianity, but was killed in a Persecution he
raised, before he had reigned two years.&nbsp; Errors increased
daily.&nbsp; About the beginning of the sixth century the Church
seemed more tranquil, but the Devil was incessantly working her
ruin by the introduction of Popish errors; ignorance and
profaneness was almost universal.&nbsp; The Government was almost
one perpetual struggle between the Bishops, which should be the
greatest.&nbsp; <i>Gregory</i> the Great, by immense
superstition, troubled the Church; and her discomfiture was soon
universal.&nbsp; This was the case of the Church in the West;
while, about this time, <i>Mahomet</i> the Arab, took his rise in
the East, and propogated his delusion there.&nbsp; Thus the Beast
rose about 606, or 666; and now, in another sense, the Church
entered into her Wilderness state, the outer Court being given to
the Gentiles, to be trodden under foot for forty-two months, or
1260 years.&nbsp; Sad indeed the consequence of the rise of the
Man of Sin.&nbsp; For many years worse Persecutions than under
the Pagans took place, but God did not leave the World without a
Witness for himself.&nbsp; Every now and then the Lord <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>raised up
faithful men, who opposed the Pope&rsquo;s Supremacy;
particularly <i>Luther</i>, in
<i>Germany</i>&mdash;<i>Zuinglius</i>, in <i>Switzerland</i>, and
<i>Calvin</i>; in <i>France</i>.&nbsp; The christian Religion, as
taught by <i>Luther</i>, was established in <i>Demark</i>,
<i>Sweden</i>, and <i>Germany</i>.&nbsp; The Doctrines taught by
<i>Calvin</i>, in <i>Holland</i>, <i>Scotland</i>,
<i>England</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>; but in <i>Ireland</i> the
Persecution was dreadful indeed, and not much less in
<i>England</i>.&nbsp; The Popish massacre of about three hundred
thousand Protestants in <i>Ireland</i>, and the Persecution in
<i>England</i>, bid fair to abolish the Protestant cause among
us.&nbsp; In <i>France</i> the Persecution was
dreadful&mdash;<i>Lewis</i> the 13th distressed the Protestants
greatly; numbers were barbarously murdered, and several hundred
thousand with difficulty fled to <i>Holland</i>, <i>England</i>,
and elsewhere.&nbsp; But blessed be God for the glorious
Reformation! for a Protestant King and Princes; for the Will of
God in our mother Tongue; for Parliaments that secure our Rights;
for the clear Preaching of the Gospel, which is our joy, though
we have to lament great decays among Churches; a dry,
speculative, legal System, in opposition to the pure truth, which
is branded with the odious term of Antinomianism; and in the
world an infidel spirit of Free-thinking, in opposition to the
Word of God.&nbsp; But we are looking to a glorious period, when
truth in its native simplicity, shall fly with the rapidity of
lightning, and illuminate the World; when <i>Anti-christ</i>,
<i>in the East and West</i>, <i>shall fall</i>, <i>to rise no
more</i>&mdash;when <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span><i>Zion&rsquo;s Watchmen shall see</i>, <i>eye to
eye</i>&mdash;when <i>Jews and Gentiles form one
fold</i>&mdash;when <i>peace and holiness shall be
universal</i>&mdash;when <i>kings shall be nursing fathers to the
Church</i>, <i>and the whole earth serve the Lord</i>!&nbsp;
Happy period! the Lord hasten it in his time.</p>
<p>Brethren, we shall soon be done with time, and through rich
grace, join the chorus of the skies.&mdash;Hold fast the form of
sound words: be concerned to feel the power of truth in the
heart; keep in the fear of God, obeying his will, walking as he
has set forth his mind; looking unto Jesus; praying to be kept in
all danger, temptation, persecution, and trial, and so we shall
give him glory in the Church below, and in the Church
above.&mdash;<i>Now unto him that is able to keep you from
falling</i>, <i>and to present you faultless before the presence
of his glory&mdash;to the only wise God our Saviour</i>, <i>be
glory</i>, <i>dominion</i>, <i>and power</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Amen</i>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>The following are the Articles of Faith I read at my

<p><i>We think if requisite that every Member of the Church
should give his or her assent to the annexed</i></p>
<h2><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>CONFESSION of FAITH.</h2>
<p>I.&nbsp; I BELIEVE, that the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament are the word of God, and the only rule of faith and
practice.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I believe, that there is but One only, living, and
true God; that there are three Persons in the Godhead, who are
equal in nature, power, and glory; and, that the Son and Holy
Ghost, are as truly and properly God, as the Father.&nbsp; These
Three divine Persons are distinguished from each other by
peculiar relative properties.&nbsp; These Three divine distinct
Persons, I profess to reverence, serve, and worship, as the One
true God.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; I believe that before the World began, God did
elect a certain number of Mankind unto everlasting life, whom he
did predestinate to the adoption of Children, by Jesus Christ, of
his own free grace, and according to the good pleasure of his
will; that he appointed holiness as the means: and that no one
has a right to consider himself as a chosen vessel, till he is
effectually called by the grace of God.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; I believe, that God made all things in Creation, out
of nothing, to display his goodness, wisdom, power, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and glory;
and, that by the same power, he upholds and governs, rules and
directs all things in Heaven and Earth; and, that he displays his
sovereignty according to the counsel of his own will, or his
eternal plan, formed before all Worlds.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; I believe, that there is one Mediator between God and
Man; the Man, Christ Jesus; that he stood in his mediatorial
capacity as our representative and head, in the covenant of
eternal redemption and grace; engaged to be all that to his
people, they could possibly need in time, and their bliss through
eternity.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; I believe that God made Man upright; but mutable and
liable to fall: that through the influence of Satan, he broke the
covenant of works, and fell from the image of God; that all
Mankind sinned in him and fell, with him, as their head and
representative; and both him and his posterity became liable to
the curse and penalty of a violated law.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; I believe, that all Mankind are conceived and born
in sin, Children of disobedience, enemies to God, violators of
his commands, averse to good, prone to evil, Children of wrath,
obnoxious to the justice of God, and the condemnation of his law:
and I believe, that no Creature can help or deliver himself, out
of that wretched state into which he has fallen.&nbsp; I solemnly
believe, that this is the state of all Men by nature.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; I believe, that according to the eternal
appointment of God the father, and the Covenant engagements of
the dear Redeemer, that in the fulness of time, God sent his Son
into the world to redeem fallen Men; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>that part of the human race, that was
given him in eternity; that their redemption was obtained by the
shedding of his blood; that this redemption is special and
particular, designed only for the elect of God, the Sheep of
Christ, who only share the special and peculiar blessings of
it.&nbsp; And, in order to accomplish our redemption, I believe,
it was necessary that the Redeemer should take upon him our
nature, a human body and soul, created and formed by God the
Spirit, conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary, born of a
Woman, made under the law, that he might redeem his people from
it; work out a righteousness adequate to its demands, make an
atonement by suffering the death of the Cross, satisfy divine
Justice, glorify all the attributes of Deity, and open a way for
the communication of all those blessings, which are needful for
the Saints of God, both for time and eternity.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; I believe, that the matter of the Sinners&rsquo;
justification before a holy God, is the righteousness of Christ
imputed to them; which is, his perfect, spotless obedience to the
law, in their room and stead, without the consideration of any
works done by them; and, that the full and free pardon of all
their sins, past, present, and to come, is only through the blood
of Christ, according to the riches of his grace; and, that none
can be justified in any other way.&nbsp; This righteousness being
seen by the eye of faith, and embraced by the hand of faith, we
are manifestly justified and freed from the law; that, being dead
wherein we were held, we live to God, and by love serve the Lord,
having our fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>X.&nbsp; I believe, that all the objects of eternal
love, the subjects of his choice, and the purchase of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s blood, are effectually called in one way or
other, by the efficacious and irresistible grace of God the
divine Spirit; and not by an act of Man&rsquo;s free will and
power.&nbsp; I believe they are washed, justified, and
sanctified, in the name and by God the Spirit, in some part of
their lives.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; I believe, that all saints are kept by the mighty
power of God, through faith, to eternal Salvation; and that as
sure as they are called, justified, and sanctified, they will
infallibly persevere; because of the perpetuity of God&rsquo;s
love, the stability of his covenant, and his faithfulness to his
absolute promises.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; I believe, that the Church of Christ consists of
true believers in his name; that these are his mystical body, of
which, he is the only head, and there is no other: and that all
the Children of God derive spiritual life from him, by virtue of
union to him; that he is our life; and in consequence of that, we
are now quickened by his life-giving power in conversion; our
bodies shall be quickened in the last day, and all Believers
shall enjoy eternal life, in glory for ever.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; I believe, that in the new testament Church of
Christ, there are two Sacraments: Baptism, and the Supper of the
Lord.&nbsp; I believe, Baptism to be an outward and visible sign;
first, of the sufferings, death, burial, and resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ; secondly, of an inward and spiritual operation
of the Holy Ghost, upon the hearts of believers; and is a grand
emblem of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>righteousness; for being by nature the children of
wrath, we are by regeneration, manifested to be children of
grace.&nbsp; I believe, that only those who profess the name of
Jesus, have any right thereto.&nbsp; That it should be
administered to Adults alone, in the name of the adorable
Trinity; and, that it is to be performed by immersion&mdash;but
wish to exercise the most unbounded charity to all who differ
from us in this particular.&nbsp; I believe, that the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper was instituted the night on which he was
betrayed, to represent his sufferings and death; and is to be
attended to by all Believers, until his second coming.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; I believe, that it is the duty of every Christian
to obey the laws of their Country; not to speak evil of
Dignities; but, to pray for the King, his Family, and the
Government under which we live; to study to be quiet, peaceable,
and submissive, according to the laws of Jesus Christ, which is
our rule of conduct: and, who has said, &ldquo;Render unto
C&aelig;sar, the things which are his;&rdquo; and by his holy
Apostles has commanded &ldquo;That every Soul should be subject
to the higher powers; that we should honor all Men, love the
Brotherhood, fear God, honor the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>XV.&nbsp; I believe, that it is the duty of all Believers, to
take the commands of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, as their
rule of conduct; that, while they are relying on his
Righteousness, for justification; on his Blood, for pardon; and,
on the Spirit, for internal sanctification; they, from a
principal of love shed abroad in their hearts, are made willing
to obey his laws, as King in Mount Zion: and, that his
commandments are the believer&rsquo;s rule of outward conduct;
that it is <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>their duty to stand fast in one Spirit, with one mind,
striving together for the faith of the gospel: that it is their
duty to walk in wisdom, to them that are without; to exercise a
conscience void of offence towards God and Man, by living
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world: that it is
their duty to walk with each other is all humility and brotherly
love; to watch over each other&rsquo;s conversation; to stir up
one another to love and to good works; not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together, as we have opportunity; to
worship God, according to his revealed will; and, when the case
requires, to warn, rebuke, and admonish one another, according to
the rules of the gospel: and that it is our duty to sympathize
with each other, to bear with one another&rsquo;s weaknesses,
failings, and infirmities; and, particularly to pray for one
another.&nbsp; All these duties we are bound to perform, and
every other law of Christ&rsquo;s spiritual house, through the
gracious influence of a Spirit of love, of power, and of a sound
mind; ever remembering, that we are to obey the laws of our
Sovereign, as King, on his holy hill of Zion.</p>
<p>XVI.&nbsp; I believe, that all the Ordinances of divine
appointment ought to be attended unto, by all that profess their
faith in, and love to our Lord Jesus Christ, as the head of his
Church; hearing the Word, public Prayer, Baptism, and the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper: singing of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual
Songs, vocally; this is an ordinance of the gospel, to be
performed by Believers; but, as to time, place, and manner, every
one ought to be left to their liberty in using it.</p>
<p>XVII.&nbsp; I believe, that there will be a Resurrection, both
of the just and unjust; and that Christ will come a <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>second time
to judge both quick and dead; when he will take vengeance on the
wicked, and introduce his own People into his kingdom and glory,
where they shall be for ever with him; and, then shall the
mediatorial kingdom be delivered up to the Father, by the
Redeemer; the mystery of God be finished: Heaven will be the
Saints final home; and, God, Father, Son, and Spirit, be all in
all, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>XVIII.&nbsp; I believe, that the felicity of the Saints will
be eternal; and I as firmly believe, such will be the eternity of
misery; unless, the never-dying worm dies, and this unquenchable
fire goes out; which will not, cannot be; for the mouth of the
Lord hath spoken it.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>These Sentiments we are bound to acknowledge</i>, <i>as a
Church</i>.&mdash;We wish in all things to adorn these Doctrines;
and having been called out of the world, to the knowledge of the
truth, <i>experimentally</i>&mdash;in that hope, and through
divine grace, we have given up ourselves to God&mdash;to walk in
his ways, as laid down in that part of his holy word which
respects the <i>New Testament Church</i>.&nbsp; We therefore
enter into covenant with each other, and pray for grace to keep
the following scriptural <span class="smcap">Rules</span>.</p>
<h2><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>THE
MEMBERS&rsquo; COVENANT.</h2>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Jer</span>. l. 5.&nbsp; Come,
let us join ourselves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that
shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Acts</span> ii, 2.&nbsp; And they
continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and in
fellowship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span> xxiv, 15.&nbsp; And it came to
pass that while they communed together, and reasoned, Jesus
himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>WE AGREE,</p>
<p>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">With</span> regard to the
<i>Minister</i>&mdash;that as long as God is pleased to make him
useful to our souls, and we consider him as sent of God&mdash;we
will diligently attend upon his Ministry&mdash;cheerfully submit
to and readily obey all the Ordinances he
administers&mdash;agreeable to the written word&mdash;Heb. xiii,
7.&nbsp; <i>Remember them that have the rule over you</i>, <i>who
have spoken to you the Word of God</i>.&nbsp; We further agree to
make prayer and supplication for him, to watch his conversation,
and follow him as far as he follows Christ.&nbsp; That we will
esteem him, reverence, and obey him in the Lord&mdash;agreeable
to 1 Thess. v, 13.&nbsp; <i>And we beseech you</i>, <i>Brethren
to know them which labour among you</i>, <i>and are over you in
the Lord</i>, <i>and admonish you&mdash;and to esteem them very
highly in love</i>, <i>for their Works sake</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Brethren</i>, <i>pray for us</i>.&nbsp; <i>Prayer was made
without ceasing to God for him</i>&mdash;<i>Whose faith
follow</i>, <i>considering the </i><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span><i>end of their
conversion</i>.&mdash;And we agree, according to our
circumstances, by the administration of earthly things, to
support and maintain him, agreeable to 1 Cor. xi.&nbsp; <i>If we
have sown unto you in spiritual things</i>, <i>is it a great
thing if we should reap your carnal things</i>?&nbsp; <i>Even so
hath the Lord appointed</i>.&mdash;We agree likewise to abide by
him in all trials and persecutions&mdash;that we will encourage
him, strengthen his hands, and speak kindly of him&mdash;avoiding
all bitterness of spirit, tattling and gossiping about him, as
contrary to the Gospel.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;We agree to receive and esteem all <i>Officers</i> in
the Church, that have been appointed by the Church, whose faith
and practice is conformable to the written word.&nbsp; That we
will speak kindly of them, receive reproof from them when
necessary, and make known all cases of distress, spiritual or
temporal, in the Church, to them&mdash;while we have reason to
believe they answer the spiritual character of a Deacon, as laid
down in 1 Tim. 3rd Chapter.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;We agree, through grace, to be found in the use of
all appointed means, public and private, and on special
occasions, when notified by the Minister, as in Acts xiv,
2.&nbsp; <i>When they were come</i>, <i>and had gathered the
Church together</i>.&mdash;<i>Forsake not the assembling
yourselves together</i>, <i>as the manner of some
is</i>.&mdash;<i>Where two or three are gathered together</i>,
<i>there am I in the midst</i>.&nbsp; <i>Lo</i>, <i>I am with you
always</i>.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;As Members of the same Church, we will endeavour to
cultivate an affectionate and sincere love, without
dissimulation, towards one another&mdash;<a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>like that
which Christ bears to his Church; and studiously avoid all
occasion of division among the members&mdash;such as hard
speeches, cruel and unjust remarks, disdainful looks, reproaches,
slanders, and all causeless divisions in judgment concerning
spiritual things.&nbsp; But that we will watch and pray against
these things, as injurious to the cause of Christ; but endeavor
to maintain a oneness of mind and consent of judgment, to every
grand truth, and a uniformity of practice.&mdash;<i>Ye yourselves
are taught of God to love one another</i>.&mdash;<i>Be kindly
affectioned one towards another</i>.&nbsp; <i>By this shall all
men know that ye are my disciples</i>, <i>if ye love one
another</i>.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;We mutually agree to pray for the prosperity of the
kingdom of Christ, particularly for that part to which we
belong&mdash;that body of christians which we commune with.&nbsp;
This we will do through grace, constantly, cheerfully, and
affectionately, publicly, and more frequently in
private&mdash;especially for the most tried, afflicted, and poor
members.&nbsp; <i>Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem&mdash;they
shall prosper that love her</i>.&nbsp; <i>Continuing constant in
prayer</i>.</p>
<p>6.&mdash;That, as a Church, we will, as much as possible, be
separate from the World, its customs, maxims, pursuits, &amp;
worship.&nbsp; Pray against a worldly spirit, either of levity or
sullenness, covetous of oppressive, in dealing with
others.&mdash;<i>Come out from among them</i>, <i>and be ye
separate</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;We agree to study each others spiritual benefit, and
take every opportunity, for the communion of Saints, to impart
what light or enjoyments, <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>trials, and mercies, sorrows and
deliverances.&nbsp; To avoid all frothy, light, or vain
conversation, as not becoming a Church of Christ.&nbsp; <i>Then
they that feared the Lord spake often one to another</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Let your speech be always with grace</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wherefore
comfort one another</i>, <i>and edify one another</i>, <i>as also
ye do</i>.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;We will endeavour to bear with each others
infirmities, weakness, and failings, in meekness, patience, and
pity&mdash;render them what assistance we can, by prayer, advice,
and kindness; not approving their errors, but recommending them
to the Lord, and forgiving every offence done against us, when we
believe such an offender is sorry, and will acknowledge his
sin.&nbsp; <i>Be ye kind to one to another&mdash;tender
hearted</i>.&nbsp; <i>If thy brother repent forgive
him</i>.&nbsp; <i>We that are strong ought to bear the
infirmities of the weak</i>.&nbsp; <i>Charity suffereth long</i>,
<i>and is kind</i>.&nbsp; <i>If any man have a quarrel against
any</i>, <i>even as Christ forgave you</i>, <i>so also do
ye</i>.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;We agree to sympathize with each other in the
calamities and trials that may befall us&mdash;either affliction
of body, unjust reproach, real falls, family afflictions, or
temptation and soul troubles.&nbsp; <i>Remember them that are in
bonds</i>, <i>as bound with them</i>; <i>and those who suffer
adversity</i>.&nbsp; <i>If one member suffers all the members
suffer with it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Bear ye one anothers
burdens</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ye ought to support the weak</i>.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;We agree to contribute to the real necessities of
those who are poor&mdash;in things temporal, according to every
one&rsquo;s ability.&nbsp; <i>Let us do good to all men</i>,
<i>especially the household of faith</i>.&nbsp; <i>And if thy
brother be waxen poor and fallen into decay with thee</i>, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span><i>thou shall
relieve him</i>.&nbsp; <i>Distributing to the necessity of the
saints</i>, <i>given to hospitality&mdash;for God loveth a
cheerful giver</i>.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;We mutually agree to watch over each other for
good&mdash;to comfort the feeble-minded, to warn the unruly, and
to reprove in faithfulness, wisdom, moderation, and kindness,
what we see amiss in each other&mdash;to endeavor to restore a
fallen Brother&mdash;to seek consolation for him by prayer and
the word; but if persisting in an evil cause, acquaint the
Officers of the Church, that they may take up the
cause.&mdash;<i>Brethren</i>, <i>if any of you do err from the
faith</i>, <i>and one convert</i> (<i>or restore</i>) <i>him</i>,
<i>let him know</i>, <i>that he which converteth a sinner from
the error of his way</i>, <i>shall save a soul from
death</i>.&mdash;<i>Yet count him not an enemy</i>, <i>but
admonish him as a Brother</i>.&nbsp; <i>He that being often
reproved</i>, <i>hardeneth his neck</i>, <i>shall be destroyed
without a remedy</i>.&nbsp; <i>Let us consider one
another</i>.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;We hope, through grace, to walk in all holiness of
life, to the glory of the Gospel, the edification of the Church,
and conviction to them that are without&mdash;looking unto Jesus,
depending on his unmerited favour, rejoicing in his Person and
Work, and lodging for the happy time, when we shall join the
Church triumphant in heaven.&mdash;<i>Let your light so
shine</i>.&nbsp; <i>Having these promises</i>, <i>let us cleanse
ourselves</i>.&mdash;<i>See that ye walk circumspectly</i>.</p>
<p>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
inheritance among them that are sanctified, by faith in Christ
Jesus.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
